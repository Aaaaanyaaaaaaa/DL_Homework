        "\n",
        "The plan for the homework is as follows:\n",
        "1. Load and prepare data (you'll use `UDPOS` dataset from [torchtext](https://pytorch.org/text/))\n",
        "2. Build baseline Conv model (already implemented for you)\n",
        "3. Implement training pipeline and train/evaluate baseline model\n",
        "4. Build Transformer (all fun is here!)\n",
        "5. Train/evaluate Transformer model (here you'll reuse the pipeline from pt. 3)\n",
        "6. Write a of short report\n",
        "\n",
        "## Grading (10 points total)\n",
        "The main metric in this homework is accuracy calculated on the **test** set (please, don't train on test set – it will be easily revealed by the TAs). Also, you are not allowed to change train/val/test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The points are allocated to tasks as follows:\n",
        " 1. **[3 points]** Training and evaluation of baseline Conv model (don't change the model architecture!). The test accuracy must be **> 82.5%**\n",
        " 2. **[7 points]** Implementation, training and evaluation of Transformer model. The test accuracy must be **> 85%**\n",
        " \n",
        "Your homework submission should contain:\n",
        "1. Fully functional notebook, which has to reproduce all the reported results by clicking on the \"Run all\" button. The notebook must contain the filled in report (see the template in the very end of the notebook).\n",
        "2. Saved weights of the best models `ConvPOSTagger.best.pth` and `TransformerPOSTagger.best.pth` (saving is already implemented for you).\n",
        "3. The screenshots of accuracy curves from Tensorboard for both models on validation dataset.\n",

        "- Do not start writing code before you have read and understood the theory.\n",
        "- Read all the text in this notebook (hope, you're reading this).\n",
        "- Make one change at a time: never change several things at once (unless you are super confident). Train a model, introduce one change, train again.\n",
        "- Use Tensorboard. If you use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) check this [hack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57791702).\n",
        "- Pay much attention to accuracy and loss curves (e.g. in Tensorboard). Track failures early, stop bad experiments early.\n",

        "ConvNets can be better than Transformers in POS-tagging task in the case of small data. In this homework you'll train models on a very small dataset (12 543 train sentences) which is ridiculous on the scale of modern NLP datasets (millions or even billions of sentences!). Anyway, it's very important to understand how Transformers work and to be ready to apply them in a real-world problem with a large dataset, where Transformers outperform other architectures (Conv, RNN, ...) with a large margin.\n",

So, if our input sequence was 5 tokens long we would have $Z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$. Why do we call this a sequence of context vectors and not a sequence of hidden states? A hidden state at time $t$ in an RNN has only seen tokens $x_t$ and all the tokens before it. However, each context vector here has seen all tokens at all positions within the input sequence.\n",

        "First, the tokens are passed through a standard embedding layer. Next, as the model has no recurrence it has no idea about the order of the tokens within the sequence. We solve this by using a second embedding layer called a *positional embedding layer*. This is a standard embedding layer where the input is not the token itself but the position of the token within the sequence, starting with the first token, the `<bos>` (beginning of sequence) token, in position 0. The position embedding has a \"vocabulary\" size of `max_length`, which means our model can accept sentences up to `max_length` tokens long.\n",

        "The original Transformer implementation from the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper does not learn positional embeddings. Instead it uses a fixed static embedding. Modern Transformer architectures, like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), use positional embeddings instead, so we'll use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the token and positional embeddings are elementwise summed together to get a vector which contains information about the token and also its position within the sequence. However, before they are summed, the token embeddings are multiplied by a scaling factor which is $\\sqrt{d_{model}}$, where $d_{model}$ is the hidden dimension size, `hid_dim`. This (supposedly) reduces variance in the embeddings and the model is difficult to train reliably without this scaling factor. Dropout is then applied to the combined embeddings.\n",

        "The mask, `mask`, is simply the same shape as the source sentence but has a value of 1 when the token in the source sentence is not a `<pad>` token and 0 when it is a `<pad>` token. This is used in the encoder layers to mask the multi-head attention mechanisms, which are used to calculate and apply attention over the source sentence, so the model does not pay attention to `<pad>` tokens, which contain no useful information."

        "\n",
        "The Transformer uses *scaled dot-product attention*, where the query and the key are combined by taking the dot product between them, then applying the softmax operation, scaling by $d_k$ and finally multiplying by the value. $d_k$ is the *head dimension*, `head_dim`, which we will shortly explain further.\n",

Instead of doing a single attention application the queries, keys and values have their `hid_dim` split into $h$ *heads* and the scaled dot-product attention is calculated over all heads in parallel. This means instead of paying attention to one concept per attention application, we pay attention to $h$. We then re-combine the heads into their `hid_dim` shape, thus each `hid_dim` is potentially paying attention to $h$ different concepts.\n",

        "1. Calculate $QW^Q$, $KW^K$ and $VW^V$ with the linear layers, `fc_q`, `fc_k` and `fc_v` to get `Q`, `K` and `V`.\n",
        "2. Split the `hid_dim` of the query, key and value into `n_heads` (use `.view`) and correctly permute them so they can be multiplied together.\n",
        "3. Calculate the `energy` (the un-normalized attention) by multiplying `Q` and `K` together and scaling it by the square root of `head_dim`, which is calculated as `hid_dim // n_heads`. Mask the energy not to pay attention over any elements of the sequence we shouldn't.\n",

        "\n",
        "Note that in our implementation the lengths of the keys and values are always the same, thus when matrix multiplying the output of the softmax, `attention`, with `V` we will always have valid dimension sizes for matrix multiplication. This multiplication is carried out using `torch.matmul` (or `@` operator) which, when both tensors are >2-dimensional, does a batched matrix multiplication over the last two dimensions of each tensor. This will be a **[query len, key len] x [value len, head dim]** batched matrix multiplication over the batch size and each head which provides the **[batch size, n heads, query len, head dim]** result.\n",

This means that our attention vector will most probably not sum to 1 and we may pay full attention to a token but the attention over that token is set to 0 by dropout. This is never explained, or even mentioned, in the paper however is used by the [official implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/) and every Transformer implementation since, [including BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/)."
